**Anime Recommender System**
Tagline: "Discover your next favorite anime with our AI-powered recommendation engine!"


üìñ Description
--------------

Welcome to the Anime Recommender System, a machine learning project that uses natural language processing and collaborative filtering to suggest anime shows based on user preferences. The system is built using Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit, and is designed to provide personalized recommendations to users.

The project consists of four main components: data preprocessing, model training, recommendation generation, and a web-based interface for users to interact with the system. The data preprocessing module loads and cleans the anime dataset, while the model training module trains a neural network to predict user ratings based on their anime preferences. The recommendation generation module uses the trained model to generate personalized recommendations for users, and the web-based interface uses Streamlit to provide an intuitive user interface for users to interact with the system.


‚ú® Features
------------

1. **Natural Language Processing**: The system uses NLP techniques to analyze the anime dataset and extract relevant features from the text data.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: The system uses collaborative filtering to generate recommendations based on the preferences of similar users.
3. **Neural Network Model**: The system uses a neural network to train a model that predicts user ratings based on their anime preferences.
4. **Web-Based Interface**: The system provides a web-based interface using Streamlit for users to interact with the system and receive personalized recommendations.
5. **Data Preprocessing**: The system includes a data preprocessing module that loads and cleans the anime dataset.
6. **Model Training**: The system includes a model training module that trains the neural network model using the anime dataset.
7. **Recommendation Generation**: The system includes a recommendation generation module that generates personalized recommendations for users based on their anime preferences.
8. **User Profiling**: The system includes a user profiling module that creates profiles for users based on their anime preferences.
